#tool
A [[LAMP (Localization and Mapping Platform)|LAMP]] system using 4 [[CLLBC]] (Cs<sub>2</sub>LiLa(Br,Cl)<sub>6</sub>:Ce) crystals in a 2 by 2 configuration. Each crystal is 1x1x2".

CLLBC is an excellent scintillator for gamma spectroscopy and also sensitive to neutrons through the <sup>6</sup>Li (n,Î±) neutron capture.

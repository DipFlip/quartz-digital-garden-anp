Geant4 (GEometry ANd Tracking) is a C++ framework for simulating the passage of particles through matter using Monte Carlo methods.

Some useful tools for simulating detectors with Geant4 has been written in [Geant4py](https://gitlab.com/lbl-anp/geant4py).

Projects that use Geant4:
- [[PyUDM (Python Urban Deployment Model)]] simulates the detector response for gamma rays in [[2x4x16‚Äù NaI(Tl)]]
- [[MLCCD (Machine Learning methods for Charge Coupled Devices)]] use Geant4 to simulate particles' energy deposition in CCD detectors.

CLLBC is a gamma-ray and neutron scintillator crystal made of Cs<sub>2</sub>LiLa(Br,Cl)<sub>6</sub>:Ce

CLLBC is an excellent scintillator for gamma spectroscopy and also sensitive to neutrons through the <sup>6</sup>Li (n,Î±) neutron capture.

It was discovered and patented by [[RMD (Radiation Monitoring Devices Inc.)|RMD]] by replacing yttrium in another popular scintillator CLYC with lanthanum and some bromine. CLLBC has higher light output and better energy resolution than CLYC.

CLLBC is used in [[NG LAMP (Neutron Gamma LAMP)]].

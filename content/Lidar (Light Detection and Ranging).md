Lidars use spinning lasers to measure distances to lots of points around it. The data can be analyzed using [[SLAM (Simultanious Localization and Mapping)|SLAM]] to create 3D maps of environments and the location of a system within the environment.

In [[ANP (Appled Nuclear Physics)|ANP]] the "puck" [Velodyne VLP16](https://velodynelidar.com/products/puck/) is very popular. It has 16 beams, 100 m range, and relatively good price at ~$4500 each ( #TODO confirm price).

In 2023 the Emesent Hovermap was purchased by [[ANP (Appled Nuclear Physics)|ANP]]. The Hovermap can create higher resolution pointmaps using their equivalent of a puck and proprietrary [[SLAM (Simultanious Localization and Mapping)|SLAM]] solution.

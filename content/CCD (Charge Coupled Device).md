Semiconductorbased sensors (typically silicon) that are used in digital cameras but that can also be used for particle detection. For particle detection, thick (~200-700µm) CCDs have been developed at [[LBNL (Lawrence Berkeley National Lab)|LBNL]] where the voltage is adjusted to reach a fully-depleted mode. When fully depleted, the electric field is strong enough to collect all generated charge carriers (electrons and holes) quickly.

Example of a CCD image resulting from a 30-second measurement of the radiological background made with a 650 μm thick, LBNL-developed CCD with 3052 x 3052 10.5 μm pixels.  The image is taken from Ref. [Hol06](http://escholarship.org/uc/item/6ft833qz).
CCD detectors are used in the projects:
- [[MLCCD (Machine Learning methods for Charge Coupled Devices)]]
- [[QuIPS (Quantum Invisible Particle Sensor)]]

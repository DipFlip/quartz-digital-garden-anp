Mission: Develop and deploy algorithms that leverage the unique capabilities of networked detection systems to deliver enhanced radiological/nuclear source detection, localization, and tracking

Collaborators:
- [[ANP (Appled Nuclear Physics)]]
    - Project lead
    - Radiological and contextual sensing algorithms
    - Network-level data fusion and tracking algorithms
- [[PNNL (Pacific Northwest National Laboratory)]]
    - Open-source data analysis for radiological pattern of life
    - Integration of open source intelligence data with radiological and contextual data for enhanced domain awareness
- [[ANL (Argonne National Laboratory)]]
    - Developed a "virtual [[Waggle]]"


Predecessor projects that lead to PANDA:
- [[NOVArray]]: data provided by [[RSL (Remote Sensing Laboratory)|RSL]] is used before nodes in Chicago are up. Background data measured in NOVArray forms the bases on which [[Pandaemonium]] generates detector backgrounds used in simulating detector networks in [[PyUDM (Python Urban Deployment Model)]].

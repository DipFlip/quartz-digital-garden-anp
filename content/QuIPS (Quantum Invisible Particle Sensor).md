The project aims to use radioisotopes loaded into silica spheres, levitated by **optical tweezers**. When an isotope decays, the recoil of the sphere is measured, along with other decay products. This data can then be used to look for evidence of invisible decay products like heavy sterile neutrinos or axions.
The detection of the visible decay products and the sphere recoil momentum vector can be used to kinematically reconstruct the momentum vector of the decay, and thereby quantify the possibility of invisible decay products

Plan to have first measured results for sterile neutrino seach in 3 years.

#project 
This project aims to develop advanced machine learning algorithms for better identification of particle tracks in highly-segmented semiconductor detectors. The project will focus on tritium detection using [[CCD (Charge Coupled Device)]] detectors that are thick, fully depleted, and highly pixelated. Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and Graph Neural Network (GNN) algorithms will be employed to distinguish low-energy beta particles from tritium decay, while eliminating background noise from alpha particles, gamma rays, and cosmic rays. Using an information-theoretic approach, the project will evaluate limiting factors and sensitivity in tritium detection. Successful implementation will advance tritium detection technology and offer new tools for future applications in particle identification.
